Repository Design Pattern
---

Overview The Repository Design Pattern decouples data access logic from the business logic in the application, promoting modularity and testability.
Implementation In this project, repositories were created for managing data access for the Users, Playlist, Song, and Artist entities. These repositories encapsulate CRUD operations and any additional data access logic, making the application easier to maintain and extend.

---

Benefits :
---
Separation of Concerns: Keeps data access logic separate from business logic.
Testability: Allows for mocking data access during unit tests.
Flexibility: Facilitates changes in data access strategy without affecting business logic.

New Navigation and Routing Functionalities
In this lab, we have added new routing functionalities to manage the relationships between playlists, songs, and artists in the Tunify platform. These enhancements allow users to interact with the platform through specific API endpoints designed for adding and retrieving songs in relation to playlists and artists.

Playlist-Song Relationships

Endpoint: POST api/playlists/{playlistId}/songs/{songId} Description: This endpoint allows users to add a specific song to a playlist. The playlistId and songId are passed as route parameters to identify the playlist and the song to be added.

Retrieve All Songs in a Playlist:
Endpoint: GET api/Songs/GetSongsByPlaylist/2

Description: This endpoint retrieves all the songs associated with a specific playlist. The playlistId is passed as a route parameter to identify the playlist.
